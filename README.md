# InfusionSoft PHP SDK Generator
This generates an update php sdk for the InfusionSoft API by scraping the documentation provided by InfusionSoft. Using this makes sure you always have the latest methods available to you as it creates the php code LIVE.

## How to Use

## Documentation
This will also create php documentation using phpdoc comment blocks which are inserted during the scraping/creation. This documentation is actually much clearer and more informative compared to the provided documetation for the php sdk.
